Domain 1 — Architecture & AI Data Cloud (31%)
This is the biggest domain — don't skim it.
Core Architecture

The 3-layer model: Storage, Compute (Virtual Warehouses), Cloud Services
Separation of compute and storage — why it matters for scaling and cost
Multi-cluster shared data architecture
Snowflake editions: Standard, Enterprise, Business Critical, Virtual Private Snowflake
Deployment on AWS, Azure, GCP — regions and cross-cloud concepts

Virtual Warehouses

Sizes (XS → 6XL) and credit consumption
Auto-suspend and auto-resume behavior
Multi-cluster warehouses: auto-scaling vs. maximized mode
Query queuing and concurrency slots
Resource monitors — setting credit limits and alerts

Storage Layer

Columnar storage, compression, micro-partitions
Automatic clustering vs. explicit clustering keys
When to use clustering (large tables, frequent range filters)
Search Optimization Service

Caching (critical exam topic)

Result cache — 24-hour reuse, when it invalidates
Local disk cache (SSD) — warehouse-level, evicts on suspend
Remote disk cache (S3/Blob/GCS) — persistent metadata/data cache
Metadata cache in Cloud Services layer

Snowflake AI & Cortex (new C03 focus)

Cortex AI SQL functions: COMPLETE, SENTIMENT, SUMMARIZE, CLASSIFY_TEXT, EXTRACT_ANSWER, TRANSLATE
Cortex Search — semantic search on unstructured text
Cortex Analyst — natural language to SQL
Document AI — extract structured data from PDFs
Snowflake Notebooks — interactive Python/SQL notebooks
Streamlit in Snowflake — building data apps
Snowpark — Python/Java/Scala DataFrames running inside Snowflake
ML Model Registry, Feature Store basics


Domain 2 — Performance Optimization, Querying & Transformation (21%)
Query Performance

Query Profile — reading the execution plan, identifying bottlenecks
Spilling to disk vs. spilling to remote — causes and fixes
Pruning via micro-partitions — how predicates on clustering keys prune data
Avoiding full table scans

Warehouse Optimization

Right-sizing warehouses for different workloads (ETL vs. ad-hoc vs. BI)
Separate warehouses per workload type for isolation
Multi-cluster for concurrency vs. scaling up for complex queries

SQL & Transformation

DDL: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, UNDROP
DML: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, COPY INTO
Window functions, lateral joins, FLATTEN for semi-structured
CTEs, subqueries, QUALIFY clause
Tasks — scheduling SQL/Stored Procedures, DAG-based task graphs
Streams — CDC (Change Data Capture): standard, append-only, insert-only streams
Stored Procedures (JavaScript, Python, Snowpark)
UDFs — scalar, tabular (UDTFs), JavaScript and Python

Semi-Structured Data

VARIANT, ARRAY, OBJECT data types
Querying JSON using colon notation: src:key::string
FLATTEN function for nested arrays
PARSE_JSON, TRY_PARSE_JSON, OBJECT_CONSTRUCT


Domain 3 — Account Management & Data Governance (20%)
Account Structure

Organizations, Accounts, Databases, Schemas, Objects hierarchy
Account identifiers — locator vs. org-based
Snowflake URL formats

Access Control (RBAC)

Role hierarchy: ORGADMIN → ACCOUNTADMIN → SYSADMIN → USERADMIN → SECURITYADMIN → PUBLIC
Principle of least privilege — granting to roles not users
Secondary roles (new C03 emphasis) — USE SECONDARY ROLES
Object ownership and privilege inheritance
Managed Access Schemas — only schema owner can grant

Security

Network Policies — IP whitelisting/blacklisting
MFA enforcement
OAuth, SAML 2.0 (SSO), Key-pair authentication, Okta integration
Private Link / PrivateLink for VPC connectivity
Tri-Secret Secure (HSM + Snowflake + customer key)
End-to-end encryption: AES-256 at rest, TLS in transit
Automatic key rotation (30-day default), periodic rekeying

Data Governance

Dynamic Data Masking — masking policies on columns by role
Row Access Policies — filter rows by user/role context
Object Tagging — tagging columns, tables for classification
Data Classification — PRIVACY_CATEGORY, SEMANTIC_CATEGORY system tags
Access History — SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY view
Column-level security

Compliance & Audit

ACCOUNT_USAGE schema vs. INFORMATION_SCHEMA — latency differences (45 min to 3 hrs vs. real-time)
Key views: QUERY_HISTORY, LOGIN_HISTORY, COPY_HISTORY, WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
FinOps & Cost Attribution — resource monitors, cost per warehouse, credit attribution


Domain 4 — Data Loading, Unloading & Connectivity (18%)
Stages

Internal stages: User (@~), Table (@%tablename), Named (@mystagename)
External stages: S3, Azure Blob, GCS — using STORAGE INTEGRATION
Directory tables on stages

COPY INTO

COPY INTO <table> FROM @stage — key syntax
File formats: CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet, ORC, XML
Validation modes: RETURN_ERRORS, RETURN_ALL_ERRORS, RETURN_N_ROWS
ON_ERROR options: CONTINUE, SKIP_FILE, ABORT_STATEMENT
Partial loading — PURGE option, load history
FORCE = TRUE to reload previously loaded files

Snowpipe (Continuous Ingestion)

Auto-ingest using SQS/event notifications
REST API approach for push-based loading
Snowpipe billing — per-second compute (not warehouse credits)
Load metadata retained for 64 days

Data Unloading

COPY INTO @stage FROM <table/query>
SINGLE = TRUE/FALSE, MAX_FILE_SIZE, HEADER

Connectivity Tools

Snowsight (web UI)
SnowSQL (CLI)
JDBC/ODBC drivers
Python Connector
Snowflake Connector for Spark, Kafka
SnowCD — connectivity diagnostic tool
SQL API — REST-based query execution

Git Integration (new in C03)

Connecting Snowflake to Git repositories
CI/CD concepts for Snowflake development


Domain 5 — Data Collaboration (10%)
Secure Data Sharing

Share objects — read-only, no data movement or copying
Provider/Consumer model — can share across accounts, not within same account
What can be shared: tables, views, secure views, UDFs, streams
Direct sharing requires accounts in same region and cloud (or with replication)
Snowflake Marketplace — publishing and consuming data listings

Data Replication

Replication Groups and Failover Groups
Cross-region, cross-cloud replication — RPO/RTO concepts
Replicating databases, shares, tasks, resource monitors

Data Protection

Time Travel: 0–1 day (Standard), 0–90 days (Enterprise+)
AT and BEFORE syntax for querying historical data
UNDROP — for tables, schemas, databases
Fail-safe: 7 days after Time Travel expiry (Snowflake-managed only, not user accessible)
Cloning — zero-copy clone, clones Time Travel history is independent


Study Rubric — Priority Order
Tier 1 (Master These First)
Architecture layers, virtual warehouse behavior, caching types, RBAC roles, COPY INTO mechanics, Time Travel + Fail-safe, streams + tasks
Tier 2 (High Yield)
Clustering, query profiling, data masking, row access policies, Snowpipe, file formats, data sharing model, ACCOUNT_USAGE views
Tier 3 (C03 Differentiators — Don't Skip)
Cortex AI functions, Snowpark basics, Streamlit in Snowflake, Notebooks, Git integration, secondary roles, Document AI

Study Plan (4–6 Weeks)
Week 1–2: Snowflake free trial + Snowflake University "Level Up" series (free). Hands-on with loading data, querying, creating warehouses.
Week 3–4: Go through official COF-C03 Study Guide topic by topic, cross-referencing Snowflake docs for each concept. The exam is 100% doc-referenceable.
Week 5: Practice exams. Target 85%+ before sitting. ExamTopics has 1,000+ community questions (note: some answers in comments are more reliable than the listed answers).
Week 6: Weak area review. Re-read docs on anything below 80% in practice scores.
